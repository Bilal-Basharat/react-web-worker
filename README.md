# React Sorting App using Web Worker

In this project we will sort data using web workers to increase the effiency and performance of the web application.

## Web Workers
They are simply JavaScript modules that can be run in the background of a web page. JavaScript is a single threaded responsible for executing all of the code one line at a time. While a web worker is a separate Javascript thread that allows the main thread to continue executing without blocking. This enables the creation of responsive, smooth, and interactive websites.

## Types of Web Workers
They are of two types:

## service workers
They can manage static assets and cache them for offline use.

## background scripts
They can perform long-running tasks such as data processing, calculations, or network requests.
