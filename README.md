# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Sorting Data using Web-Worker 
In this repository I will implement a Sorting algorithms in web app using react.js. Basically, the purpose of this reposiotry is to implement web workers for heavy computations to improve performance of the web app.

## Web Workers
They are simply JavaScript modules that can be run in the background of a web page. JavaScript is a single threaded responsible for executing all of the code one line at a time. While a web worker is a separate Javascript thread that allows the main thread to continue executing without blocking. This enables the creation of responsive, smooth, and interactive websites.

## Types of Web Workers
They are of two types:

## service workers
They can manage static assets and cache them for offline use.

## background scripts
They can perform long-running tasks such as data processing, calculations, or network requests.

## Note:
Web workers cannot perform DOM Manipulation
