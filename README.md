# Sorting Data using Web-Worker 
In this repository I will implement a Sorting algorithms in web app using react.js. Basically, the purpose of this reposiotry is to implement web workers for heavy computations to improve performance of the web app.

## Web Workers
They are simply JavaScript modules that can be run in the background of a web page. JavaScript is a single threaded responsible for executing all of the code one line at a time. While a web worker is a separate Javascript thread that allows the main thread to continue executing without blocking. This enables the creation of responsive, smooth, and interactive websites.

## Types of Web Workers
They are of two types:

## service workers
They can manage static assets and cache them for offline use.

## background scripts
They can perform long-running tasks such as data processing, calculations, or network requests.

## Note:
Web workers cannot perform DOM Manipulation
